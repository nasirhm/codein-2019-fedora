## Hashing and Hash Cracking

## Organization : Fedora Project

Description : `Hash functions are used all over the internet in order to securely store passwords, find duplicate records, quickly store and retrieve data, and more. No matter the input, the output of a hash function always has the same size. Encryption can be decrypted but, hashing can not be DE-Hashed(There is no such thing as dehashing). As we can't De-hash string we need to crack them. In this task you need to create a script that does both hashing and cracking. It should support the following Hash Functions:`

    md5
    sha1
    sha224
    sha256
    sha384
    sha512

`I have attached a link showing how it should work. If you want you can add cool features like online cracking, etc.`
